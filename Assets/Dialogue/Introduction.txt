Avo: [title=Begin]
Avo: Hello there and welcome to the avocado factory! 
Avo: It's our job, and now your job too, to label avocados before they're sent out to supermarkets.
Avo: It's pretty easy. 
Avo: Avocados that need labelling will appear out of that green box to your left.
Avo: They'll travel along the conveyors until they reach the truck.
Avo: It's your job to close the gates by clicking on them to direct the avocados to the labellers.
Avo: You can click on labeller to change which label it'll apply, and mouse over avocados to see what labels they need.
Avo: Make sure each avocado has the correct labels before it reaches the truck!
Avo: Oh, and sometimes other fruit gets in the mix too, make sure you redirect those to the bin.
Avo: Okay, have fun on your first shift!
