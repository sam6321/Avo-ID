Avo: [title=Begin]
Avo: Hello! Welcome to the avocado factory! 
Avo: Your job is to label avocados.
Avo: Avocados enter from the left.
Avo: They travel along the conveyors until they reach the truck.
Avo: Your job is to direct the avocados to labellers using gates.
Avo: You can click on a labeller to change which label it will apply. Mouse over avocados to see what labels they need.
Avo: Make sure each avocado has the correct labels before it reaches the truck!
Avo: Oh, and sometimes other fruit gets in the mix too. Make sure you redirect those to the bin.
Avo: Have fun on your first shift!
